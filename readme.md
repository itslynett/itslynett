# Lynett Maina â€” Cybersecurity Student & Full-Stack Developer

*"Building secure systems while writing code that matters."*

I am a **Cybersecurity student** and a **MERN/Django Stack Developer** with a strong interest in creating applications that are not only functional, but also secure and resilient. My work is guided by the belief that technology should inspire confidence, not vulnerability.

## Who I Am
